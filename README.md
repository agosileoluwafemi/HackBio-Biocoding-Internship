# HackBio-Biocoding-Internship
HackBio is a bioinformatics platform that teaches bioinformatics skills to newbies to advanced bioinformaticians. In this internship, I signed up for a **Coding for Life Scientists: Python** course, which involves studying, practicing (coding), and assessments sessions. The course is in 4 stages to help newbies develop essential skills in python.
## Stage 0
### Module 1: python syntax 
<p> Hello World! <br>
Print statement. <br>
Comments. <br>
Variables. <br>
Single or double quotes. <br>
Python is case sensitive. <br>
Naming variables: legal and illegal ways. <br>
Assigning multiple variables. </p>

### Module 2: Data structures
<p> Python Data Types. <br>
Strings: Adding, slicing, and modifying. <br>
F-strings. <br>
Booleans. <br>
Python as a calculator. <br>
Differential expression. </p>

### Module 3: Data structures
<p> List: Accessing, modifying, adding, and removing items. <br>
Nested lists. <br>
Tuples: creating, accessing, and usage in life science. <br>
Dictionary: creating, and accessing values. <br>
Adding, modifying, and Revoming entries. <br>
Working with biological data. </p>

### Assessment
Use any data structure of your choice to organize the following information. Don’t use functions, loops, conditionals or any complex concepts. Your code should include a final print statement that prints the organized output in a logical and understandable way:
<p> Your names. <br>
Your slack username. <br>
Your email. <br>
Your hobby. <br>
Your countries. <br>
Your discipline. <br>
Your preferred programming language. </p>

### Solution
<p> In this exercise, I used the dictionary to nest all information above. <br>
